                <p>If you've had a positive COVID-19 test, you should wait 4 weeks 
                   from the date you had the test before you book an appointment.
                </p>
                <p>If you were under 30 years old on 30 March 2021, you will not 
                   be offered appointments for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. 
                   There may be fewer appointments available or you may have to travel further.
                </p>
                <p>  If you are pregnant, speak to a healthcare professional
                     from your maternity team or GP surgery before booking. 
                     It's preferable for you to have the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, 
                     which are not available at all vaccination sites.
