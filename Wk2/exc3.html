               <ul>
                <li>acquire basic research skills,</li>
                <li>carry out sustained independent work</li>
                <li> select an area for further investigation and present a project proposal based around a candidate research question</li>
                <li>refine the research question as improved understanding of theory and practice is achieved</li>
                <li> select and justify the paradigm and/or methodology chosen</li>
                <li> develop and extend their critical and evaluative skills·</li> 
                <li> produce a dissertation thesis of about 15,000 words and defend the final outcome.</li>

                Databases represent a vital resource in the vast majority of computer 
                systems, particularly Internet-based systems. This module is designed for 
                students to study different database systems – from the traditional 
                relational databases to recent NoSQL databases, etc. This module starts 
                with some basic database concepts and modelling skills and quickly moves
                on to more advanced concepts and systems to cover the required breadth 
                and depth of the module. There are plenty of built in practical tasks for 
                students to reinforce their learning.

            <p>This module concentrates on creating object-based solutions to 
                software problems within a contemporary integrated development 
                environment. It focuses on the concepts of object technology and 
                the syntax and semantics of the underlying model 
                while promoting good practice in software construction and testing.
